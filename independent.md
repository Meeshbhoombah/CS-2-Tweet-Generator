# Independent Study (Term 2)
Rohan Mishra

## Overview
This course is designed to give me the skills I need to implement my own Blockchain
with [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth). I will build off
my past experience with back-end web development (validated by testing into Web2 and
completing a project that utilizes the technologies covered in Web1) to learn Go
and build my own functional implementation blockchain.

By the end of the course I will have a strong grasp of golang and Geth, as well as
a concrete understanding of what the "Blockchain" is.

## Competencies
By the end of this study, I will be able to:
- Understand what sets Go apart from other languages
- Implement arrays, linked-lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables in Go
- Utilize Go's inbuilt testing framework to test programs
- Demonstrate a strong understanding of concurrency and error-handing
- Build RESTful APIs and web apps in Go
- Interact with popular Javascript libraries in Go
- Understand the various developments in blockchain technology:

- Synthesize an understanding of the limitations of the Blockchain technology
- Implement my own fork of the Etherum blockchain using `Geth`
- Build a very basic blockchain from scratch to serve as a database
