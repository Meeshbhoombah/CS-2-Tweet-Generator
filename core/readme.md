   Everyday I get up at 5:00 AM, this gives additional time to get

   also meditate everyday when I first get up.

   I usually sleep very late and get very little amounts of sleep.
   I also do not maintiain diet or execercise which is probably
   ailing me.

   I use to nap all the time and would feel really sleep. I improved
   this by working out and doing more active activities in order to
   sustain myself.

   I want to start exercising everyday, eat well, and sleep well.
