# CS2 Notes
This class centers on building a Tweet Generator from a random corpus
of words.

## The Iterative Steps
1. Randomly generating words from a dictionary
2. Make a Flask web app and deploy it to Heroku
3. Sample words from a Markov grammar model
4. Collect a corpus and analyze word frequency
5. Connect to Twitter API to generate tweets

## Project Goals
- Python scripting and web app development
- Text processing of a natural (human) langugage
- Probablity and Markov Models
- Data structures and performance analysis
- Regular expressions

## Focus on
- Python programming proficiency
- Familiarity with tools, modules, and libraries
- Useful tradeoffs for data structures
- Write clean code - make it maintainable
